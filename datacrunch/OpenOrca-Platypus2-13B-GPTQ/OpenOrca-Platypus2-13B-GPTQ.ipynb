It keeps losing cellular connection with an E symbol. I need to reboot this phone every time to keep it connected to LTE service. I can not return this phone now or Helpdesk is able to help me to resolve this issue.\n",
      "1 2023-11-07 14:38:57.664676 after the phone updates it informs you that it is now compatible with verizons network. Had to return. It worked great before the update though.\n",
      "2 2023-11-07 14:39:03.779616 GREAT PHONE! Does everything & anything YOU want to in a cell phone. great value & a great batttery-lasts all day & night. better value than Iphone 13. and much. much. cheaper!!!\n",
      "3 2023-11-07 14:39:14.700524 It is Great! Holds a charge for a couple of days. It is quick. My son's really likes it. Great price too.\n",
      "4 2023-11-07 14:39:20.255604 I am enjoying my phone , it is working smooth and it is fast when I load the new apps it is the fastest cell I ever have.\n",
      "5 2023-11-07 14:39:22.820759 I liked the size of the phone. So far it is working very good, fast and easy to navigate the phone.\n",
      "6 2023-11-07 14:39:28.052614 This is a great phone for that price and many great features.\n",
      "7 2023-11-07 14:39:32.948238 Very responsive, camera work good for the most part.\n",
      "8 2023-11-07 14:39:39.425874 great phone for the conscious user. 7h SOT with very intensive use during the first use.\n",

      "11 2023-11-07 14:39:54.915974 wow , this is a vary nice cell phone at a nice price. It feels great to handle, feels comfy in your hand, not too bulky or heavy, though heaver than my last rugged phone . Very fast opening apps , easy to use easy to see, colours on the screen are bright and clear, i like it very much an can recommend it.\n",
      "12 2023-11-07 14:40:10.364003 The format is pleasant in the hand. The screen is readable in direct sunlight, no problem on that side. Autonomy level, again Blackview keeps its promises, and I suppose the same goes for robustness. The problem comes from the software processing of the photo announced as a 'miracle' thanks to ArcSoft, a US company which provides software solutions in the field of the image which is supposed to be on board this smartphone. Despite the description of this BV5200 Pro, the reality is quite different. The photos are almost unusable as they are pitted and dull. The HDR mode is inoperative and I switch to the night mode which delivers a porridge. I already had a Blackview BV5100 in the past, the ancestor of this BV5200 Pro which did much better. In short, Blackview is regressing but at the same time, what can we expect from a rugged smartphone at this price? Certainly no miracles, I confirm it to you. 1 star is still too much. Thank you for reading this review, hope it helps you. Less\n",
      "13 2023-11-07 14:40:25.864006 I chose this smartphone for its robustness and its autonomy. Its 5180 mAh battery allows you to recharge it every two or three days. It is also handy for using it as a GPS on long journeys without having to plug it into the cigarette lighter. Its design is very beautiful for an unbreakable phone: the colored band, a photo lens in the shape of a drop of water, the finish of the keys, the waterproof covers as well as the protective she will. It is also thinner than others. unbreakable models. The handling is intuitive and pleasant. Facial recognition is a plus compared to other models of the brand. The quality of the photos is more than adequate for an unbreakable phone, especially with its many possible settings (night mode, beauty mode (adjustable), panoramic, etc. ). Note however that there is no jack for any headphones, but I use wireless headphones for my part. Less\n",
      "14 2023-11-07 14:40:41.383300 Too expensive, compared to the previous model, the a60. With the same performance, felt by the user. Positive: battery charging time Negative: screen saver time not modifiable. No fingerprint sensor\n",
      "15 2023-11-07 14:40:47.834443 I was looking for an Android phone that could replace my old phone that just left me. And I came across this brand for its - It is powerful, has a fingerprint sensor, facial recognition, several cameras for different zooms. - The configuration is very fast and the photo management efficient. -In terms of autonomy, we have a huge battery that lasts well. -a very powerful speaker that really impressed me for a phone like that. -it is fluid with a good processor accompanied by 4 GB of ram + 128 GB of rom. I recommend it because it is perfect for Intense use At this price it is top\n",
      "16 2023-11-07 14:40:55.223873 Smartphone perfect for a teenager who breaks everything! In addition, its black and green look gives it the appearance of a gamer's accessory and not that of a smartphone of a public construction site employee.\n",
      "17 2023-11-07 14:41:00.349205 Phone that works well in terms of applications, but in terms of calls it is a disaster, my interlocutors do not hear what I am saying. Phone only for apps and sms.\n",
      "18 2023-11-07 14:41:04.290414 easy to use phone, fast process. The quality of the photos is great. The memory large enough to be able to save files. The strap behind the phone is practical, it allows you to hold the phone well.\n",

      "20 2023-11-07 14:41:10.718424 Very functional phone with the small torch, the fingerprint reader on the edge which is well placed, the processor is sufficient for the Web and games, APN more than adequate with a wide angle, the 128 gigabytes of storage allows you to do without a memory card, large capacity, The sound remains correct with no parasitic noise, gives an impression of robustness hence its weight and dimensions more marked than a classic 5. 5 inch.\n",

      "24 2023-11-07 14:41:38.630599 I like the slightly heavier mobiles, like Ulefone. Ordinary mobile phones too often feel like plastic toys in the hand. The battery lasts for several days even with a lot of use. Stylish design and fun to play with. An affordable phone, which also charges quickly. An experience for both the hand and the eye. The headphones work, but if there will be an updated version of this model, the headphones must have a better connection to the phone so that it does not become choppy when the phone is in the pocket and the earphones are in the ears. A case should also be included in the box for convenience. But Ulefone has made a cool first model of a mobile with built-in headphones. If you can continue and take it to the next level without losing the nice design, it can be great without paying exorbitant prices. Less\n",
      "25 2023-11-07 14:41:54.068099 A really good cell phone for a heavy-duty man. An excellent addition is the Bluetooth headphones, which are always charged and included because they are integrated directly into the cell phone frame. The frame is really strong and will certainly withstand even the most demanding conditions. You can use it to shoot underwater if needed :).\n",
      "26 2023-11-07 14:41:58.847160 Large battery, lasts almost a whole week without needing to be charged. Good as a work phone. The only 'flaw' is that the supplied earplugs have a rather harsh sound.\n",
      "27 2023-11-07 14:42:02.610243 Good phone, a little big, a little heavy, but not bad with its integrated headphones. Very good listening, I recommend it! The screen is a bit small for games, too bad😏\n",
      "28 2023-11-07 14:42:05.743850 Very satisfied, a very good phone, I recommend a serious company, thank you\n",
      "29 2023-11-07 14:42:11.579069 You cannot get everything for this money. So the camera side is bad in this model. Otherwise, it is a good game for the price.\n",
      "30 2023-11-07 14:42:15.009118 I came across a factory defect, the touch went crazy after charging the phone when the phone was warm\n",

      "36 2023-11-07 14:42:46.920286 Good durable mobile, a little bigger than expected.\n",
      "37 2023-11-07 14:42:54.098444 after a week the phone stopped working and for that week I had to charge it every day I do not recommend it\n",
      "38 2023-11-07 14:42:58.389274 Great phone in tough conditions.\n",
      "39 2023-11-07 14:43:04.033969 Here are my experiences after a good month of use. The battery really lasts quite a long time, about 3-4 days of heavy use, almost up to a week if you do not drool all the time. The screen is really clear and you can see very well in sunny weather, even in direct sunlight. It came with a 66W charger, but the old charging plate 10W works, about 30% to a full battery at night during sleep (7h). So I have not used the charger that came with it, yet. The cameras work decently in poor lighting, but the flash/flashlight is really bright and improves the description of dark objects considerably. Listening to music is possible, the built-in speaker is good for hearing, maybe too loud at times. When working with Raksa, so I bought this phone because of its durability and water resistance, the phone has already 'swimmed' and dropped a few times and there is no visible damage. The 'frame' of the phone is rubber and takes shocks perfectly. In this model, the protection of the cameras was taken into account, there is a small 'rubber frame' around the cameras to protect the camera lenses from impacts. The old 5100 Nokia's shells were probably made of the same rubber ;) The price was 'expensive', but if the handset lasts for a good two years again, it is not a bad deal. I am very satisfied, already my third Ulefone, so I am not changing the brand of 'durable' phones. Less\n",
      "40 2023-11-07 14:43:16.712593 The product corresponds to my wishes and the statements on the website. The case is well stiffened, the battery is big enough. If you disable location, 5G connectivity (when they are not needed) and use the Data Saver correctly, the battery lasts over 10 days with normal use. It allows a granular customization that obviously requires some time, during the initial setup of the phone. Importing data from the old phone (it had Android 8), through the settings application, did not work correctly. The old data was imported through Google and through the computer. It connects well via Bluetooth, including the Smartwatch. The localization is very fast if there is data connectivity, if not, it takes almost 3 minutes. I tested it on 5G and it works correctly. Charging the battery takes less than 1. 5 hours (20% to 100%) with the 66W charger, which is very good. On the old phone (10600 mAh) it lasted 6 hours. Very fast Wi-Fi if connected to a 5. 8GHz (802. 11ac) access point. The microphone is directional, so you have to know which side to speak from when using it on the loudspeaker (hands-free). The phone was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. Less\n",
      "41 2023-11-07 14:43:28.161148 When I opened the package, my first thought was that 'now it is crazy'. The phone felt like a big lump in the grip. The transition from the old phone's Android 13 -> Power Armor's Android 12 went well. A couple of insignificant softwares were not installed. In use, two things shine above the others. Size and battery life. The size is just the right size to fit in the thigh pocket of the down pants. That is a small minus, Snafist is physically too big. The brutal durability of the battery is positive. No matter how you load the phone, there is 50% left in the evening. And of course wireless charging. . The package came with sceen shield - Pro Tip included - which is good to position the upper edge first. Summa summarum; when you want a phone that works as a smartphone, a hammer and a backup power source, choose this one. You will not be disappointed. My lord, my blood is big physically, but excellent otherwise. Less\n",
      "42 2023-11-07 14:43:35.575349 The phone has been in use for about a month. The phone works well and the battery lasts about two and a half days with quite heavy internet browsing, which is a good thing. All necessary programs run well. The only thing that would be missing would be a rear camera armor glass that would protect the camera lenses. The protections of the phone seem to be sufficient and after a few drops there are no problems. I recommend it to everyone who is considering a durable phone.\n",
      "43 2023-11-07 14:43:40.644735 You get used to the phone's large size and massive weight quite quickly. Those are actually the only things worth criticizing, you can feel the quality and durability in your fingers! The general impression is what was promised, a durable Android with a large battery. The only downsides to ease of use come from the fact that it is not easy to find racks that work for, for example, a car or bike, and universal racks or accessories are not a solution.\n",
      "44 2023-11-07 14:43:44.978867 A robust product, with unsophisticated, simple software. A phone that you do not have to worry about getting scratched, getting wet, etc. Personally, I was excited by the microscope in the camera. It is exactly what a phone should be, especially if you do extreme sports and only.\n",
      "45 2023-11-07 14:43:54.002120 Unbreakable phone with super battery. With normal use, it lasts up to 4 days. It is a bit heavy, but that does not bother me. So far, I have been using Armor 7 for 4 years - it fell on concrete / tiles many times and there was no trace on the screen :) For me, there is nothing better on the market than this series. Great quality and equipment at a good price.\n",
      "46 2023-11-07 14:43:59.500464 Otherwise, a great phone and a wonderfully long-lasting battery, but the usability disappears when the applications do not work: basic messages arrive with a delay of hours, and the scaling of e. g. Snapchat is not at all right. The camera does not open and up-to-date system updates are simply not available or known. So avoid this buying mistake!\n",
      "47 2023-11-07 14:44:04.984583 An excellent price-quality phone. No other brand offers what this phone offers. The only thing I do not like is the video stabilization, it is not ok. Everything else is ok.\n",
      "48 2023-11-07 14:44:11.041924 An excellent phone with good features, a good price, a good processor and excellent build quality, it exceeded all my expectations, I was able to emulate PSP without any problem, the games run excellent, totally recommended.\n",
      "49 2023-11-07 14:44:17.322148 After the update, it reboots and the only rescue for a while is to choose the option to restore factory settings. After turning off and on, some system application error and for the phone to work is . Factory reset.\n",
      "50 2023-11-07 14:44:25.623015 Good product but worse with the delivery, the product was at the warehouse three days before delivery to the agent.\n",

      "54 2023-11-07 14:44:47.119946 it is good cell phone, good cameras, high responding which means good processor and nice shapeI liked the screen size and I disliked fingerprint position.\n",
      "55 2023-11-07 14:44:52.429941 My old phone was out of date and slow. My new one is much better.\n",
      "56 2023-11-07 14:45:00.238851 It is nice and friendly user but a little Heavy to carry\n",
      "57 2023-11-07 14:45:03.798692 Annoying google that has spread all over the system. The phone does not even automatically download numbers from the SIM card, it only attacks google and wants to connect and suck numbers from google. You have to go to settings to download contacts. Generally, at least the phone allows a lot of personalization, also managed to turn off those disgusting notifications, internet gossip appearing on the side screen supported by google. The photos are quite nice indoors, although the corners are actually out of focus. As I expected from Nokia, I can be heard well on the interlocutor.\n",
      "58 2023-11-07 14:45:11.170185 Bought for husband. I have been using for over a year. The battery holds up well, and you know, now there are apps for almost everything. At a reasonable price we have 5g, large capacity, contactless payments. The fingerprint works very well, the system works smoothly, the phone is quite loud, you can easily listen to an audiobook while doing some work. I decided on Nokia guided by a certain sentiment and I was not disappointed, the smartphone meets all my expectations.\n",
      "59 2023-11-07 14:45:17.817518 Good quality product, nice sound and nice display. Good workmanship. I recommend\n",

      "71 2023-11-07 14:46:21.493077 I have been using HTC phones (Desire 500, U11 dual Sim and U11 life) for many years. Compared to the old U11 dual SIM (which unfortunately broke after a battery change), I am just as satisfied with the Desire 22 pro for my everyday use - taking phone calls with 2 SIM cards, WhatsApp, the Internet and taking photos of the children. Only the accessories have become leaner (earphones are no longer included) and the sound is a bit worse, which does not bother me since I do not listen to much music on my cell phone. The color of my YOU 11 was second to none (solar red), the golden Desire 22 pro falls off a bit. But that is not so important.\n",
      "72 2023-11-07 14:46:27.393620 It was cheaper and there was an official trade-in campaign, so I switched from U11. Good battery life when new. It is a little vertical and feels heavy. I feel like the camera is getting harder to use. It is good that it has an earphone jack, but it is not good to have one main speaker and monaural when playing videos. Sound quality is also bad. Other than that, I was able to switch to the current situation without any discomfort. It would be nice to have a fingerprint scanner on the power button. I wonder if the HTC-likeness is decreasing. It seems that the VR headset (flow) and the set are recommended and show their true value, but the essential flow is honestly a delicate spec. The late-starting new VR goggles look good. I am personally satisfied, but I do not think it is necessary for newcomers to choose.\n",
      "73 2023-11-07 14:46:34.745992 Coming from the 20 pro model, the new Desire 22 Pro looks good, fluid and with a good photographic sector. Battery lasts me 2 days with average use (emails/websites/whatsapp/photos and videos) *no gaming*, I tried wireless charging with 15w but it is very slow better with cable. For now updated Android 12 ver. security 1/09/2022 Build 1. 04. 2401. 2\n",
      "74 2023-11-07 14:46:50.506903 It is at least my 6th HTC smartphone and I am a little disappointed. What made the charm of HTC ('Telephone' applications, 'Messages', etc . ) has disappeared to the detriment of Google applications which do not work at all the same. The camera is not up to par (quality and focusing leave something to be desired). Otherwise the phone is OK.\n",
      "75 2023-11-07 14:46:54.355547 After the purchase, I had problems with making phone calls, interference, interruptions, dropping calls, inability to make a connection despite the good range indicated on the display. I decided to send the phone back, suspecting a manufacturing defect. After receiving the refund, I bought another one, the same but in a different store and again I have a problem with making calls. I used two other sim cards from different operators and the connection problem is the same. I was clearly convinced that the model has a repetitive factory defect when, talking with serious interference, I left the building and the connection quality improved immediately, without interrupting the conversation, I returned to the building and after a few steps inside, the connection quality deteriorated again. Two identical defects in two identical phones from two different stores are hardly a coincidence. Different sim cards, different operators, supposedly full range and you cannot talk. Moving the same sim card to the old dilapidated phone and there is no problem !!! Failure . Less\n",
      "76 2023-11-07 14:47:10.002016 Is my 4th HTC phone. Previously 5 years the U11 life until the battery weakened. Are always solid quality phones with good performance. Exactly the right thing for me as a 'non-mobile phone freak' (and Apple rejecter).\n",
      "77 2023-11-07 14:47:16.022614 I am very positively surprised that such a 'cheap' cell phone works so well! Was always a huge fan of Samsung, I now realize that prices like Samsung or Apple do not need it. I am curious how long I will enjoy it, would recommend it.\n",
      "78 2023-11-07 14:47:22.952742 Super invincible good seller, fast delivery, good product, super shipping speed, super product quality, super CP value, super service\n",
      "79 2023-11-07 14:47:29.780742 A Realme or Oppo for 350. 00 is definitely more fun. HTC Desire 22 Pro has nothing in common with all other Htc devices, too bad.\n",
      "80 2023-11-07 14:47:37.562004 Excellent value for money, excellent performance of the phone which turns out to be lacking in camera performance when compared to other devices of the same range while waiting to receive the update to Android 13 already received by devices of the same and lower range\n",
      "81 2023-11-07 14:47:41.226432 A superb product. Quality and reliability plus remarkable battery life. I am delighted\n",
      "82 2023-11-07 14:47:44.589661 It has many advantages at this price, but it has a basic disadvantage - poor range not compensated by VoWiFi support (yes, but Polish networks do not accept it)\n",
      "83 2023-11-07 14:47:51.882602 HTC has now returned and has always been an excellent smartphone . good price equal to others much more expensive than advertised .\n",
      "84 2023-11-07 14:47:56.231738 The ordered product has been received, the seller delivered the goods quickly, the logistics is also very good, the customer service attitude is excellent, very patient, and gives people a sense of intimacy, I like it very much. There is also exquisite packaging, high-end atmosphere and high-grade; it can be seen that the merchant is very careful.\n",
      "85 2023-11-07 14:48:01.922586 I am not satisfied I will complain about a refund or replacement of the camera so much money and the phone loses coverage or is completely missing updates are not done every day I hear it several times . you cannot hear you so much money for the phone and zero satisfaction.\n",
      "86 2023-11-07 14:48:06.582350 Simple and complete\n",
      "87 2023-11-07 14:48:11.460359 I was thinking about whether to keep it or return it, but in the end it conquered me, as it is, with pluses and minuses. You know the official presentation, I will not repeat it, these are my personal conclusions after a month of use. Strengths: - Very durable construction, feels good in the hand. Unfortunately, he slipped from the windowsill on the first floor and fell 4 meters into a cement ditch. It was chosen with 2 discrete side scratches, but it still works perfectly. Maybe I was lucky, but it was the moment when I chose to keep it, it passed the test. -Clear and bright screen, the sound of the speakers is very strong; watching movies is a real pleasure-It works smoothly, I never got stuck-The cameras deliver unexpectedly good photos in strong/medium light, rivaling much better rated phones. In low light the quality of the photos drops a lot, it is not a phone for night photos. The PRO photo mode is a joke, it has no use. Weak points: - The phone is VERY slippery (that is why it fell off the windowsill); it would really need an adherent silicone cover, but that is not available - The IR camera is a cute, useful gadget, but the photos are indicative, far from usable. - The battery is quite small and discharges quickly in some applications , could be higher. For normal use, it lasts decently for a day. To compensate, the 66w charger is really efficient, the battery charges very quickly, about 2 - 3% per minute. -Despite the advertisements, the phone is not totally waterproof. I washed it for 15 seconds under a moderate stream of water, without excesses, and the speakers were 'drowned', I could no longer talk on the phone. Fortunately, it recovered completely after a few hours, when it dried. - The side buttons are TOO accessible, the phone frequently activates in your pocket. Conclusion: If you are willing to accept its limitations and compensate for them, it is a great phone. It remains to be seen how it will behave over time. Less\n",
      "88 2023-11-07 14:48:19.922928 A very nice phone. It is not a speed demon, but that is not the point. It lasts me over a week on a single charge. The phone is quite massive, resistant to impacts and falling from a height (which I accidentally checked myself) and heavy enough, but it still looks great. A very delicate proprietary android overlay does not bother me at all and so far I have not noticed any problems in the operation of the system. Call quality is good, volume is excellent. The screen is readable even in direct sunlight. In my opinion, a great choice for active people and for work in difficult conditions.\n",
      "89 2023-11-07 14:48:28.819175 A very cool phone! for the first time I decided on a 'pancerniak' and it was a bull's-eye!!! The device works very well, it is very fast, it took 10 minutes to copy all the information along with all the applications from the previous phone and that is it. it is just a matter of logging in to the application. Lenses. the quality of the photos knocked me down 👍👍👍 and this price. shock!!! This is a phone that met all my expectations. The weight is also acceptable. I RECOMMEND\n",
      "90 2023-11-07 14:48:44.204926 The phone is really great. Of the most important: Radio without the need to connect headphones (the input also has an input) Fast processor and 120hz refresh rate - you can play! Battery - use all day and you will not discharge it. There is also a practical handle (cover) with a clip - it comes in handy in construction. Really good hard phone resistant to dust and water and probably one of the few gorillaglass armored ones\n",
      "91 2023-11-07 14:48:50.272968 Generally, I would not buy it again, the Android system without any manufacturer's overlay, such as miui in xiaomi, works just like that, the additional programmable button works only when the screen is awake, otherwise not (if you turn on the flashlight and turn off the screen, you cannot turn it off later, you have to wake up the screen). The screen unlock/lock button sometimes works sometimes not or you have to press it several times to lock the phone. A big plus for durability and recording under water and batteries, but that is about it.\n",
      "92 2023-11-07 14:49:02.499636 Notkowizja on the plus side, but this good quality camera is not visible at all, it takes worse pictures than not one Samsung flagship or even an iPhone xr. It is comfortable to hold in hand, weighs a little less than a good power bank, as for this price it is an ordinary phone with an android overlay. The packaging and the way of packing is a great plus, it was pleasant to unpack.\n",
      "93 2023-11-07 14:49:06.694319 Great phone. Good performance. Nice picture quality. A default: the loud sound even at minimum.\n",
      "94 2023-11-07 14:49:12.187426 The phone looks really good with great features, for example the professional quality of the camera 106MB, RAM 8GB, ROM 258GB and the powerful MediaTek Helio G99 system chip processor and Android 12 operating system.\n",
      "95 2023-11-07 14:49:16.999321 A solid phone in the original packaging, which also contained extras, such as a bow. The phone is quite large and heavy but fits well in the hand.\n",
      "96 2023-11-07 14:49:22.453339 Good product.\n",
      "97 2023-11-07 14:49:29.649624 A solid smartphone, speed sufficient for everyday use, an additional button on the housing that can soon be configured in your own way\n",
      "98 2023-11-07 14:49:32.454693 perfect for those who need a robust mobile phone that is equally compatible with other mobile phones\n",
      "99 2023-11-07 14:49:36.248573 The phone I was looking for is armored, resistant but looks similar to a standard smartphone\n",

      "107 2023-11-07 14:50:19.466622 I love the battery life, i put my phone on the charger about every third day. The ruggedness of the phone is handy. Being water proof helps so you do not have to worry about your phone falling in the water. The cons: it being a Chinese made phone, taking it to the phone repair shop for repairs is a hassle. Because they do not really know how to work on it. Another problem I have been having with the phone is if i do not use it for a couple of hours. I have to reboot the phone just to read articles or fully surf the web. Other than that i like the phone. It is definitely a good rugged device.\n",

      "109 2023-11-07 14:50:32.988378 Armored Monster! It is a pity that it does not have more stars, because it would certainly get it! From phone reviews and a pro reviews after a few shortcomings like a few words not translated from English. in the Menu, it is no exaggeration, there is nothing to pick on such nonsense! The phone is solid, holds firmly in the hand, a powerful battery, a very good camera: in the dark with a flash it takes very good pictures. I would buy it again without hesitation!\n",
      "110 2023-11-07 14:50:39.642712 Phone 100% as expected. Big, heavy and light as a feather. The camera also takes pictures and videos very nicely, but there is no zoom here because it only reaches x2. For complete happiness, you only need to buy an elegant case. Worth the price.\n",
      "111 2023-11-07 14:50:45.009952 Currently the hottest phone on the market. I am fully satisfied with the quality and prices.\n",

      "113 2023-11-07 14:50:51.903652 Prompt order, men's phone with an autonomy of up to 5 days with average use (telephony, data service, 'on' continuously, moderate use of social networks), the people from Oukitel have also worked on the camera and the pictures - they were amazed.\n",
      "114 2023-11-07 14:50:56.438278 The best phone I have had mega battery. Just great. I recommend without hesitation. (Little big) kidney or backpack needed, but worth it anyway.\n",

      "123 2023-11-07 14:51:45.685155 Impressive by its size, its capabilities (photo, . ) and especially its battery! I absolutely do not regret my purchase . for the moment RAS I find my account - I agree . I hesitated since this brand is absolutely unknown in France / before I was at Archos\n",
      "124 2023-11-07 14:51:50.566629 great phone except the battery which discharges quite quickly\n",

      "126 2023-11-07 14:52:01.672270 it works very well less heavy than the wp6\n",
      "127 2023-11-07 14:52:08.854865 I decided to make myself a gift and took this smart. What can I say, the games on it just fly, on my old and close there was no such speed, I could not always play normally. The screen is cool and bright, the videos are generally great to watch, especially while I get to work or at home on a day off. And here we must pay tribute to the fact that good stereo speakers were installed. I have never noticed that he was warming himself or stupid, which is also nice. Well, fast charging is just a great cherry on the cake to all the other pluses. I strongly recommend this smartphone!\n",
      "128 2023-11-07 14:52:13.935329 I have been using it for about a month now and it is amazing, mega-fast processor, lots of RAM plus virtual memory, so nothing cuts out and hangs here. Over time, I will probably feel the lack of built-in memory, but for now I have a lot of stock. Cons, of course, could not be missing - the camera, not to say a tragedy . is really weak, takes much worse photos than the Redmi note 7 I had, I have already tried all camera modes and options and the quality is poor, I do not know what it depends on, but the number of pixels does not match the quality of the photos taken.\n",
      "129 2023-11-07 14:52:18.732295 At the price of 1500, there is no competition in new smartphones when it comes to performance and screen. Switching from Poco x3 pro 8/256 is a screen difference definitely a plus. There is no ghosting when scrolling and colors are more vivid. The camera is sufficient, the photos come out well, a little worse than the flagships, but there is no tragedy.\n",
      "130 2023-11-07 14:52:23.291245 Overall, the phone is nice, but surprisingly the battery holds worse than my previous phone (POCO X3 PRO), although it has the same capacity. In addition, the fingerprint scanner is poorly solved, and taking screenshots is annoying.\n",
      "131 2023-11-07 14:52:28.332268 I have been 4 days at the moment I like everything, fluidity, battery, screen, cameras etc etc. I liked it very much,\n",
      "132 2023-11-07 14:52:35.254267 Purchased phone, supposedly new, but it is a 'storage deckchair' production date 07/22/2022, discharged to 0.\n",
      "133 2023-11-07 14:52:42.045485 Very good phone I love it I hope they can also put the realme Naruto\n",

      "149 2023-11-07 14:54:05.429516 If, like me, you want a 'small' handset that does not resemble a portable tv, the options are pretty limited. Having flirted with the Google Pixel 6A, and finding the low screen refresh rate really obvious and detrimental to my moderate surfing needs, I instead opted for the Moto Edge 30 Neo. Great choice! Zippy usage, no lag, lovely bright screen, and I was up and running in no time. The 'professional teccie reviews' for this unit are favourable, but still grumble about the camera capabilities, but no complaints here. So far, crisp colourful shots in all shades of daylight. Way better than my old smartphone. Out of the box, you even get a plug with your charging cable (Hurrah!) and a clear plastic 'back cover' to stop your new toy getting scratched. And a big thank you to the in-store Tech team in Norwich - patient, professional and excellent service. All of which is why this happy customer wrote a review. Now if you will excuse me, I have got some photos to take.  Less\n",
      "150 2023-11-07 14:54:11.119474 My previous phone was a monster, could not really use with one hand so I decided to go for something smaller, but had limited choices for a snapdragon, oled, wireless charging, wide-screen camera, splash proof, 120hz, dual sim phone, which were my requirements. Only thing missing was audio jack but whatever. The unit is extremely light compared to previous, transferred everything via USB, came with cable and charger, very surprised at how fast it charges, 30 mins to 100%, good accuracy with keyboard, night camera not so good, does not have built in GPS. Overall pleased even with these marginal drawbacks.\n",
      "151 2023-11-07 14:54:20.389330 I purchased this mobile as a temporary replacement for my Xioami m11, which has developed a camera fault (no pun intended). I generally do a lot of research into any phone before i choose the one I want, almost never choosing the same make as my previous mobile. I looked at the Moto Edge 20's when they came out but the specs did not match other phones at the time but whilst looking I came across the Edge 30 models, the Edge 30 Neo stood out for me and although I have taken a slight step back in regards to screen size, camera and processor speed I am not disappointed with the phones quality, build and storage capacity, for £320 it was money well spent.\n",
      "152 2023-11-07 14:54:26.278246 Overall happy with the phone. It is bigger than I wanted bit that seems to be the way they are all going these days. Would have been 5 stars except that the case is a little 'slippery' and difficult to stop it slipping around in (or out of) hour hand.\n",
      "153 2023-11-07 14:54:32.272658 I bought this phone for my partner and he could not be happier great phone does everything he needs it to do. Used to have iPhone moved to Motorola needed an upgradenever looked back great phones\n",

      "156 2023-11-07 14:54:42.649040 I received this device to test, by review. nl. The device feels lightweight and the finish is neat. I already received mine in a nice slim case so you do not have to buy it. With its size, the device fits comfortably in the hand and is not too big. Once you get started, you will notice that the device responds very quickly and everything works effortlessly. Handy features are fast and wireless charging and a number of handy hand movements that you will receive an explanation about in the so-called MOTO app: For example, you can quickly switch on your flashlight by shaking the device twice and open the camera with one hand by Turning your wrist twice, with a third turn you then switch cameras. You can also easily take a screenshot by placing 3 fingertips on the screen at the same time. The quality of the photos is disappointing compared to my expectations. it looks a bit faded and not as sharp as I expected with the high megapixels that the cameras have. All in all, a very common device with a few handy features. Less\n",
      "157 2023-11-07 14:54:49.401094 I would not buy a second time. The size of the phone (the smallest in the financial range) and good parameters made me buy it. Unfortunately, the phone, compared to the Huawei P10, which I owned for 5 years, works very poorly. On the downside: - poor system optimization, the phone has had so many spectacular crashes that I cannot count them - the fingerprint reader is best turned off . - camera - some landscapes in good lighting - standard, but take a good quality photo for the client in room - this is not possible. As a curiosity, I will add the fact that the camera cannot take a picture of a document for an accountant. I use the phone purely for business purposes - communicators, sometimes navigation, nothing else, so I really do not understand why such weakness.\n",
      "158 2023-11-07 14:55:04.785325 Typical Motorola, no superfluous apps, the image sequence with 144 Hz is unparalleled and the battery easily lasts three days! Once Motorola. always Motorola!

      "161 2023-11-07 14:55:20.347184 The image on the screen has a slight tint of green. Apparently it is OLED's fault, it is worth taking this into account and reading on the internet before buying. Other than that, the rest is a plus.\n",

      "168 2023-11-07 14:55:58.853724 I recommend clean android and super fast charging\n",
      "169 2023-11-07 14:56:03.639012 Meets expectations\n",
      "170 2023-11-07 14:56:08.431337 Excellent quality and beautiful design\n",
      "171 2023-11-07 14:56:10.732562 I am happy\n",
      "172 2023-11-07 14:56:14.575891 Light and handy, very fast, good sound, razor-sharp screen, photos and videos are also at a good level, so I do not know who writes these opinions that it is different. I would buy a second time\n",
      "173 2023-11-07 14:56:21.440927 Compact size, brilliant screen, featherweight, almost pure android. That is what I wanted.\n",
      "174 2023-11-07 14:56:26.835824 I recommend\n",
      "175 2023-11-07 14:56:32.312806 Small and neat.\n",
      "176 2023-11-07 14:56:38.995224 Bun.\n",
      "177 2023-11-07 14:56:43.960593 ok\n",
      "178 2023-11-07 14:56:49.635722 Phone delivered on time. Really solid construction: the device accidentally fell out of my pocket without any consequences. Pleasant handling and good quality screen. Like all these IPS screens, however, it is better to avoid viewing it in the sun! Reinstalled software without problem from playstore. The GPS works well and the 5000mAh battery makes it possible to space out refills. In short, I am satisfied for the moment. To be continued over time. Small problem related to Android Auto under Android 11: impossible to start waze on the car screen. We will have to wait for an update from Android Auto. By consulting the internet, it appears that this version of Android auto is quite buggy.\n",
      "179 2023-11-07 14:57:05.023983 I regret having bought this smartphone which is anything but unbreakable. After a few small falls in the apartment, it is unusable. The seller does not want to do anything even if the guarantee is valid. I had smartphones (not unbreakable) (ex xi. ) much more robust and more efficient (and cheaper. )\n",
      "180 2023-11-07 14:57:09.829487 The product corresponds to the advertised expectation. Despite being a robust and impact-resistant model, it did not prevent the glass from cracking the only time it fell to the ground. However, it continues to function normally.\n"
